<h1 align="center">AI Laptop Recommender</h1>
Hello! This is a simple little app that asks AI to find you a new laptop, which is useful if you don't know anything about laptops.

## üìñ How to use:

You can visit the app here on Vercel: 

Simply type in your budget, how much you use your laptop, and what programs you tend to use. It will then give you a recommendation along with Amazon and Google links. 

## Tech Used

- OpenAI API (Used in the [Weaviate QnA OpenAI Module](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/reader-generator-modules/qna-openai)
- Weaviate Cluster for [Vector Searching](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/quickstart)
- Open source [Laptop Price Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juanmerinobermejo/laptops-price-dataset?resource=download)
  - This is where I got the data points for the kinds of laptops, etc, from, and what I trained the Weaviate model on.
- The frontend and Next.js structure of the application is forked from the [SQL translator by whoiskatrin](https://github.com/whoiskatrin/sql-translator)
